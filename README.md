# GTA5-SkipIntro

Another inefficient way to bypass GTA5 intro video. By replacing the original `rockstar_logos.bik` with this file, you can skip the intro step after seeing just one frame of the video.

   located at:

   ```
2. Locate the file `rockstar_logos.bik` in the `movies` folder.
3. Back up the original `rockstar_logos.bik` file (optional but recommended).
4. Replace the original file with the provided `rockstar_logos.bik` from this repository.
5. Launch GTA5 and enjoy skipping the intro after a single frame.
